Rock or Mine Prediction using Sonar Signals

Overview

This Machine Learning project predicts whether an object is a Rock or Mine using sonar signal data. The model is trained on the Sonar dataset and implemented using Google Colab.

Technologies Used

Python

Google Colab

Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib

Scikit-Learn

Machine Learning Algorithms (Logistic Regression, SVM, Random Forest, etc.)

Dataset

The dataset contains sonar signals reflected from different surfaces.

Features: 60 numerical values representing sonar wave frequencies.

Target: Rock (R) or Mine (M) classification.

Source: UCI Machine Learning Repository

Features

Data Preprocessing (Handling missing values, scaling features)

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) for insights

Training and evaluating multiple ML models

Hyperparameter tuning for optimization

Model deployment readiness

My Role

As the Developer, I was responsible for:

Data Collection & Preprocessing to clean and analyze the dataset.

Feature Engineering to improve model accuracy.

Training and Testing Models to find the best-performing algorithm.

Visualization & Interpretation of model results.

Documentation & Optimization for future improvements.
